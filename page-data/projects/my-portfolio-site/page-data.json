This portfolio site\nI've built should give me the change to reflect on own self learnings and visibility over what things\nI have worked on!</p>\n<h2>My Motivation</h2>\n<p>I decided to create my own portfolio site after having completed a large end to end project using\nserverless technology (<a href=\"/projects/serverless-quizzes/\">see here</a>). I had done two brown bag talks\nabout the technology so far, one on using serverless technology and another web sockets and using\nAmazon's API Gateway. I didn't want the work I had done to end up in a git repo and that be the end\nof it. I also spend 10% of my time at work doing self learning, so there is bound to be more extended\nprojects that I'd want to showcase.</p>\n<p>I'd like to state, this is foremost a place for me to reflect on my own self learning and to have\nvisibility on the things I have done.</p>\n<h2>Technology choices</h2>\n<p>When choosing a framework to create my project, there was two things I had decided to begin with. I\ndidn't want to use a template where it's created for me already and all I do is add my posts. Secondly,\nI wanted this to be an opportunity to try a framework I hadn't used before. In the past, I'd only\ncreated web apps with Vue.js v2. In the end I had three choices; Jekyll, React, and Gatsby. As I\nwanted to make the comparison of React and Vue, I leaned heavily towards Gatsby and React. However,\nwatching a YouTube video comparing the strengths of Next.js, Gatsby and React I thought that Gatsby\nwould be suited as I wasn't going to be changing this site very often, and there are a lot of great\ntools to make a blog post.</p>\n<p>The next technology choice I'd had to make was with the CSS styling. Firstly, I have no intention of\ngoing vanilla and not using a framework. Secondly, I've tried a few different frameworks for projects\nI've done; Vuetify, Bootstrap, Ionic, Bootstrap Md, and Tailwinds. Of the ones I've tried, Tailwinds\nhas given me the best experience. I prefer the utility prefer approach that you take using the\nframework. I've found that it allows you to do more powerful this and gives you a better understanding\nof the css that is being used.</p>\n<h2>Architectural Decisions</h2>\n<p>My vision for this portfolio site is to allow me to write a markdown file, upload it and not have to\ndo anything else. I structured the site in a way that the blog posts are declarative. I only need to\nadd an md file in a folder and a new route is created for it.</p>\n<p>I've used a layout component to hold the layout of a file, so that on each page I wrap the content\nso each page is consistent with the other. In Vue, where I'm coming from, it's a single page application,\nso you have an entry point, App.Vue, then the routes (or pages) in your website sit inside that\ncomponent.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 498px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e9e7c95a2e26cda40c509d27bc7fb28b/79e1b/vue-vs-gatsby-routing.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 60%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"lambda-ide\"\n        title=\"lambda-ide\"\n        src=\"/static/e9e7c95a2e26cda40c509d27bc7fb28b/79e1b/vue-vs-gatsby-routing.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e9e7c95a2e26cda40c509d27bc7fb28b/772e8/vue-vs-gatsby-routing.png 200w,\n/static/e9e7c95a2e26cda40c509d27bc7fb28b/e17e5/vue-vs-gatsby-routing.png 400w,\n/static/e9e7c95a2e26cda40c509d27bc7fb28b/79e1b/vue-vs-gatsby-routing.png 498w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Intended workflows</h2>\n<p>At this moment, I intend for there to be two types of posts I make to my portfolio. One being a\nproject, where I try to create a deliverable piece of software. I'll then right up some of my findings during the project,\nany decisions that I had to make, and some solutions to problems I ran into.</p>\n<p>The other post I'll make is a blog post. This will be a post with a smaller scope, where I share my\nown knowledge on a topic in the technology space.</p>\n<h2>Open source</h2>\n<p>I hope to make most of the projects I write about here open source, so i've started with this one.\nYou can check out the code if you're thinking of doing something similar or just curious.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/IsaacMurtagh/portfolio-gatsby\">https://github.com/IsaacMurtagh/portfolio-gatsby</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 03, 2021","slug":"/projects/my-portfolio-site/","title":"My Portfolio Site","tags":["Gatsby","React","Frontend","Open source"]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8bae6bd1-e39a-5f19-bace-9882ccc85283","frontmatter__slug":"/projects/my-portfolio-site/","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"projects"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
